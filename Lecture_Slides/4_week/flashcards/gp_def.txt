Front: What is a stochastic process?
Back: A collection of random variables indexed by some variable x ∈ X.
Front: If y = {y(x): x ∈ X}, where do the y(x) usually belong to?
Back: R.
Front: If y = {y(x): x ∈ X}, where does X usually belong to?
Back: Rⁿ
Front: How can we think of y(x)?
Back: A function of x.
Front: If |X|=∞, what is y?
Back: An infinite-dimensional process.
Front: What are FDDs?
Back: Finite-Dimensional Distributions
Front: What type of FDDs does a Gaussian process have?
Back: Gaussian
Front: What notation is used to denote the finite dimensional distribution in a Gaussian process?
Back: (y(x₁),..., y(xn)) ~ Nn(μ, Σ)
Front: How do we denote that the function y is a GP?
Back: y(·) ~ GP
