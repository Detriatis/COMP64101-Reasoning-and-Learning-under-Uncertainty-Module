Front: What are Sigmoid Belief Nets?
Back: Hierarchical latent variable models with binary latent variables and logistic regression latent CPDs

Back: A graph encoding the conditional independence statements in a distribution.
Tags: PGMs, Directed, Conditional Independence
Front: What does it mean if a graph G is an I-map of a distribution p?
Back: I(G) âŠ† I(p), that is, all the CI statements encoded by the graph G are also true in p.

Front: What is meant by a "minimal" I-map?
Back: A graph where there is no sub-graph that is still an I-map of the given distribution.

Front: What does it mean for path P to be d-separated by C?
Back: Either: P contains chain with node in C. P contains a tent with node in C or P contains collider with node not in C nor its descendant.

Front: How is a tent (fork) structure defined in a DAG with regards to CI?
Back: Observing a root node separates its children nodes.

Front: How is a collider structure defined in a DAG with regards to CI?
Back: Observing a common child node makes its parent nodes dependent.

Front: How are conditional independencies related to d-separation in a DAG?
Back: X_A || X_B | X_C <=> A is d-separated from B given C.
