\section{Bayesian Statistics}%
\label{sec:Bayesian Statistics}
Probability theory is concerned with predicting \(p(D|\theta )\) however statistics is concerned with the inverse problem \(p(\theta |D)\).
In a bayesian approach the parameters \(\theta \) are unknown and the data \(D\) as fixed and known.
We compute a posterior distribution (the certainity of prediction) using Bayes rule.
\[
	p(\theta |D)=\frac{p(\theta)(p(D|\theta )}{\int_{{}}^{{}} {p(\theta ')p(D|\theta ')} \: d{\theta '} {}}
\]
