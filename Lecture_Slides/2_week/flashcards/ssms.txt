Front: What is a State Space Model (SSM)?
Back: A model that describes a system using latent variables that evolve over time and are observed through a noisy process.
Tags: SSMs, Intro
Front: What are the three main components of an SSM?
Back: hidden (latent) state, observations and optional inputs.
Tags: SSMs, Intro
Front: What is "state estimation" in the context of SSMs?
Back: Posterior inference about the hidden states.

Front: What is "filtering" in the context of SSMs?
Back: Estimating the hidden states sequentially using past observations.
Tags: SSMs, Filtering
Front: What is "smoothing" in the context of SSMs?
Back: Estimating the hidden states using past and future observations (offline).
Tags: SSMs, Smoothing
Front: What is the goal of the Bayes filter?
Back: Recursively compute beliefs about the hidden states.
Tags: SSMs, Filtering
Front: What type of data the Bayes filter use?
Back: Online data stream.
Tags: SSMs, Filtering
Front: What is the prediction step in Bayes filter based on?
Back: The Chapman-Kolmogorov equation.
Tags: SSMs, Filtering, Prediction
Front: What is computed in the update step of the Bayes filter?
Back: The posterior using the observation.

Front: What are FFBS used for?
Back: Combining Filtering (forward pass) with smoothing (backward pass)
Tags: SSMs, Smoothing, FFBS
Front: What is computed in the forward pass in the smoothing equations?
Back: The filter of the system.
Tags: SSMs, Smoothing
Front: What is computed in the backward pass in smoothing equations?
Back: The smoothing distributions.

Front: What does the term Gaussian Ansatz refer to?
Back: the assumption that we can work with gaussian distributions
Tags: SSMs, Gaussian Ansatz
Front: What is considered in the linear-Gaussian model?
Back: The functions that are related to the SSM are linear and noise is Gaussian.
