Front: What is the most common kernel for a GP?
Back: RBF/Squared-exponential/exponentiated quadratic
Front: What are the two parameters of the RBF kernel and what do they mean?
Back: sf (variance parameter) and l (length-scale parameter).
Front: If sf=1 and l=1 for an RBF kernel what is k(x,x')?
Back: exp(-1/2 * (x-x')Â²)
Front: How do we obtain the mean vector when sampling from a GP?
Back: From the mean function.
Front: How do we obtain the covariance matrix when sampling from a GP?
Back: From the covariance function.
