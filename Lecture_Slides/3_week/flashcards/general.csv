" What does ""BNN"" stand for?"	 Bayesian Neural Network	
 What is a core principle of BNNs?	 To represent a distribution over functions instead of a single function.	
 Why are Bayesian methods sometimes preferred in deep learning?	 They are principled, generally interpretable, and may improve generalization.	
 Why can Bayesian methods be less used sometimes?	 Computational expense	
 What are the two main kinds of generalisation for BNNs?	 In-distribution and out-of-distribution generalisation	
 What is the main difference between in- and out-of-distribution generalisation?	 The future data is drawn from the training/testing distribution (in) or from another (out)
