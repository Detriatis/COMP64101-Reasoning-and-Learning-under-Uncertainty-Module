 What are Monte Carlo methods?	 Stochastic approaches for solving numerical integration problems.	 MC, Intro
 What is the general idea of Monte Carlo integration?	 To approximate an integral by averaging function values at random samples.	 MC, Intro
 What is the Monte Carlo approximation of an expectation?	 1/Ns * sum from n=1 to Ns of φ(x_n) where x_n is a sample drawn from pi(x)	 MC, Integration
 What is a key advantage of Monte Carlo Integration?	 Its accuracy is independent of the dimensionality of x.	 MC, Integration
 Why is the importance sampling algorithm needed?	 It is hard to sample from the target distribution directly	 MC, Importance Sampling
 In importance sampling, from where do we obtain samples?	 From a proposal distribution, q(x)	 MC, Importance Sampling
 In importance sampling, how do we account for inaccuracy of using proposal distribution?	 By associating weights with each sample.	 MC, Importance Sampling
 What is a requirement for the proposal distribution in importance sampling?	 Its support must cover the support of the target distribution, supp(q) ⊇ supp(π)	 MC, Direct Importance Sampling
 What is Direct Importance Sampling?	 When the target distribution can be evaluated analytically but not sampled directly from	 MC, Direct Importance Sampling
 What are the weights associated with the samples in Direct Importance Sampling?	 They are given by π(xn) / q(xn).	 MC, Direct Importance Sampling
 What is self-normalized importance sampling used for?	 Used when we can only evaluate the unnormalized target distribution	 MC, Self-Normalized
 What does the self-normalized method approximate with importance sampling?	 the normalization constant	 MC, Self-Normalized
 What happens to the bias of the estimator in self normalized Importance sampling as the number of samples increases?	 It goes to zero under some weak assumptions	 MC, Self-Normalized
 How can a good proposal be learned for importance sampling?	 By optimizing the ELBO	 MC, Proposal
 What is the standard error in a Monte Carlo Estimate?	 O(1/sqrt(S)). S is the number of (independent) samples	 MC, Variance
 How can we reduce the variance in MC estimates?	 By using Rao-Blackwellization	 MC, Rao-Blackwellization
 When using Rao-Blackwellization, what do you need to be able to do?	 Analytically marginalize out some variables	 MC, Rao-Blackwellization
 Does the Rao-Blackwellization change bias?	 No, it's unbiased and has lower variance	 MC, Rao-Blackwellization
