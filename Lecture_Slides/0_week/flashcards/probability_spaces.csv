 What is a probability space?	 A probability space is a triple (Ω, F, P) where  Ω is the sample space, F is the event space (a σ-algebra), and P is the probability measure.	
 What is the sample space (Ω)?	 The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.	
 What is the event space (F)?	 A collection of subsets of the sample space Ω; a σ-algebra.	
 What is a σ-algebra?	 A collection F of subsets of Ω that includes the empty set and Ω, is closed under complementation, and closed under countable unions and intersections.	
 What is the probability measure (P)?	 A function P  F → [0,1] that assigns a probability to each event in the event space F, and that satisfies the Kolmogorov axioms.	
 List the Kolmogorov axioms.	 (1) P(E) ≥ 0 for all E in F. (2) P(Ω) = 1. (3) For disjoint events, P(∪ᵢEᵢ) = ΣᵢP(Eᵢ).	
" What does ""only finite additivity"" imply about the Kolmogorov axioms?"	 The additivity axiom only holds for finite sets of disjoint events, rather than countable sets. (Subjectivist approach to probability de Finetti).	
 What is meant by super/subadditivity in probability?	 Relaxation of the standard additivity axiom; can represent imprecise probabilities where probabilities are given by intervals. (Imprecise Approach to Probability Walley (1991); Augustin et al. (2014)).
