Front: Write the formula for the posterior distribution in BNNs.
Back: p(w|D, θ) = p(D|w, θ)p(w|θ) / p(D|θ)
Front: What is the numerator of the posterior formula?
Back: Likelihood times prior.
Front: What is the denominator of the posterior formula?
Back: Evidence (normalization).
Front: Write the formula for 'evidence', or the normalization term.
Back: p(D|θ) = ∫ p(D|w, θ)p(w|θ) dw
Front: In the case of supervised learning, what do we want to compute in BNNs?
Back: A posterior predictive distribution: p(y|x, D, θ).
