 What is one key property of Gaussian distributions that makes GPs useful?	 Sums of Gaussians are Gaussian, and marginal distributions of multivariate Gaussians are still Gaussian.	
 Are conditional distributions of multivariate Gaussians still Gaussian?	 Yes	
 If we condition on the FDDs of a GP, is the resulting distribution also Gaussian?	 Yes.	
 Given the covariance of a set of points, how can we predict a new point?	 As a Gaussian distribution.
