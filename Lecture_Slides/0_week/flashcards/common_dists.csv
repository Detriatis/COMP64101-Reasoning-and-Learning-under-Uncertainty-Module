 What is the binomial distribution used for?	 Modeling the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.	
 What is the categorical distribution used for?	 Modeling the probability of a variable taking on one of K different categories.	
 What is the Poisson distribution used for?	 Modeling the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time if events occur at a constant rate and are independent.	
 What are the parameters of the Gamma distribution?	 a and b, where a is a shape parameter and b is a rate parameter. The Gamma distribution has support on R+.	
 What is the Beta distribution used for?	 Modeling a probability. The Beta distribution has support on the [0,1] interval.	
 What are the parameters of the Gaussian distribution?	 μ (mean) and σ² (variance).	
 What is the central limit theorem?	 The distribution of sample means from large samples tends towards a Gaussian distribution, regardless of the underlying distribution.	
" Why is the Gaussian distribution ""not robust""?"	 Sensitive to outliers due to exponentially fast decaying tails.	
 Give examples of more robust distributions.	 Laplace, Student t, Cauchy.	
 What are the parameters of the multivariate normal distribution?	 μ (mean vector) and Σ (covariance matrix).	
 What are different forms of the covariance matrix in the multivariate Gaussian?	 Full, Diagonal, and Spherical.	
 What is a mixture of Gaussian models (GMM)?	 A probability distribution constructed as a weighted sum of multiple Gaussian distributions.	
 What is a Matrix Normal distribution used for?	 Modeling matrix-valued random variables.	
 What is the Wishart distribution used for?	 Modeling covariance matrices.	
 What is the Dirichlet distribution used for?	 Modeling probability vectors (unit simplex).
