Front: What is a probability space?
Back: A probability space is a triple (Ω, F, P) where: Ω is the sample space, F is the event space (a σ-algebra), and P is the probability measure.
Front: What is the sample space (Ω)?
Back: The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.
Front: What is the event space (F)?
Back: A collection of subsets of the sample space Ω; a σ-algebra.
Front: What is a σ-algebra?
Back: A collection F of subsets of Ω that includes the empty set and Ω, is closed under complementation, and closed under countable unions and intersections.
Front: What is the probability measure (P)?
Back: A function P: F → [0,1] that assigns a probability to each event in the event space F, and that satisfies the Kolmogorov axioms.
Front: List the Kolmogorov axioms.
Back: (1) P(E) ≥ 0 for all E in F. (2) P(Ω) = 1. (3) For disjoint events, P(∪ᵢEᵢ) = ΣᵢP(Eᵢ).
Front: What does "only finite additivity" imply about the Kolmogorov axioms?
Back: The additivity axiom only holds for finite sets of disjoint events, rather than countable sets. (Subjectivist approach to probability de Finetti).
Front: What is meant by super/subadditivity in probability?
Back: Relaxation of the standard additivity axiom; can represent imprecise probabilities where probabilities are given by intervals. (Imprecise Approach to Probability Walley (1991); Augustin et al. (2014)).
