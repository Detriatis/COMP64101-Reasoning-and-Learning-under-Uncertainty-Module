 In terms of probability models, when do you have a sigmoid belief net?	 When you have binary latent variables and the latent CPDs are logistic regression models.	 PGMs, Directed, Sigmoid
 What are the key elements when describing Conditional Independece in PGMs?	 X_A || X_B | X_C	 PGMs, Directed, Conditional Independence
 What does it mean when we say that variables X_A and X_B are conditionally independent given X_C?	 Knowing X_C renders X_A and X_B unrelated.	 PGMs, Directed, Conditional Independence
 What does an I-map represent?	 A graph encoding the conditional independence statements in a distribution.	 PGMs, Directed, Conditional Independence
 What does it mean if a graph G is an I-map of a distribution p?	 I(G) âŠ† I(p), that is, all the CI statements encoded by the graph G are also true in p.	 PGMs, Directed, Conditional Independence
" What is meant by a ""minimal"" I-map?"	 A graph where there is no sub-graph that is still an I-map of the given distribution.	 PGMs, Directed, Conditional Independence
 What does it mean for path P to be d-separated by C?	 Either  P contains chain with node in C. P contains a tent with node in C or P contains collider with node not in C nor its descendant.	 PGMs, Directed, Global Markov
 What are the three types of structures when considering d-separation	 Chain, Tent and Collider.	 PGMs, Directed, d-separation
 How is a chain structure defined in a DAG with regards to CI?	 Observing a node separates its predecessor and successor.	 PGMs, Directed, d-separation
 How is a tent (fork) structure defined in a DAG with regards to CI?	 Observing a root node separates its children nodes.	 PGMs, Directed, d-separation
 How is a collider structure defined in a DAG with regards to CI?	 Observing a common child node makes its parent nodes dependent.	 PGMs, Directed, d-separation
 How are conditional independencies related to d-separation in a DAG?	 X_A || X_B | X_C <=> A is d-separated from B given C.	 PGMs, Directed, d-separation

 What is the factorization property?	 Any distribution that is Markov to a graph, can be factored in terms of the Conditional Probability Distributions for every node.	 PGMs, Directed, Markov Properties
 What is ancestral sampling?	 A sampling method where you sample parents before children using the topological ordering in a DAG.	 PGMs, Directed, Sampling
