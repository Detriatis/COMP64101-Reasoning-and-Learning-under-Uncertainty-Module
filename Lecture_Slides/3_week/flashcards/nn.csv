 What is a neural network (NN)?	 A computational model defined by successive compositions of linear and non-linear functions.	
 What does a classical NN correspond to (graphically)?	 A graph consisting of nodes and edges linking some pairs of nodes.	
" What is a ""perceptron"" in the context of neural networks?"	 The basic building block of neural networks, performing a weighted sum with bias and applying an activation function.	
 What is the key linear operation in a neural network layer?	 An affine linear mapping, defined by a matrix and a bias vector.	
 What is the role of non-linear operations in neural network layers?	 They allow coordinate-wise application of a non-linear function to the output of the linear operation.	
 What do we stack in fully connected feedforward networks?	 Layers of linear and non-linear operations.	
" What are the ""trainable parameters"" of a neural network?"	 Entries of the matrices and bias vectors for all layers (i.e., weights).	
 What is another name for the classical fully connected feedforward NN?	 Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)	
 How are classical NNs trained?	 By optimizing parameters via Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), using gradient descent on a loss function.
