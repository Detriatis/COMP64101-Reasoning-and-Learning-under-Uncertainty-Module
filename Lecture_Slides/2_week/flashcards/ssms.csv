 What is a State Space Model (SSM)?	 A model that describes a system using latent variables that evolve over time and are observed through a noisy process.	 SSMs, Intro
 What are the three main components of an SSM?	 hidden (latent) state, observations and optional inputs.	 SSMs, Intro
" What is ""state estimation"" in the context of SSMs?"	 Posterior inference about the hidden states.	 SSMs, State Estimation
" What is ""filtering"" in the context of SSMs?"	 Estimating the hidden states sequentially using past observations.	 SSMs, Filtering
" What is ""smoothing"" in the context of SSMs?"	 Estimating the hidden states using past and future observations (offline).	 SSMs, Smoothing
 What is the goal of the Bayes filter?	 Recursively compute beliefs about the hidden states.	 SSMs, Filtering
 What type of data the Bayes filter use?	 Online data stream.	 SSMs, Filtering
 What is the prediction step in Bayes filter based on?	 The Chapman-Kolmogorov equation.	 SSMs, Filtering, Prediction
 What is computed in the update step of the Bayes filter?	 The posterior using the observation.	 SSMs, Filtering, Update
 What are FFBS used for?	 Combining Filtering (forward pass) with smoothing (backward pass)	 SSMs, Smoothing, FFBS
 What is computed in the forward pass in the smoothing equations?	 The filter of the system.	 SSMs, Smoothing
 What is computed in the backward pass in smoothing equations?	 The smoothing distributions.	 SSMs, Smoothing
 What does the term Gaussian Ansatz refer to?	 the assumption that we can work with gaussian distributions	 SSMs, Gaussian Ansatz
 What is considered in the linear-Gaussian model?	 The functions that are related to the SSM are linear and noise is Gaussian.	 SSMs, Gaussian Ansatz
