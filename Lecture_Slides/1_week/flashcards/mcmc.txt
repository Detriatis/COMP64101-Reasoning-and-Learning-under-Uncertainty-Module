Front: What is a key use of MCMC methods?
Back: Sampling from high-dimensional distributions.
Tags: MCMC, Intro
Front: What is a key part of the MCMC algorithm construction?
Back: Construct a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the target density.
Tags: MCMC, Intro
Front: In MCMC, what is a "random walk"?
Back: We perform a random walk on the state space so that the fraction of time we spend in each state is proportional to the target distribution.
Tags: MCMC, Intro
Front: What does the "mixing time" in MCMC refer to?
Back: The time it takes for the Markov chain to reach stationarity.
Tags: MCMC, Intro
Front: In MCMC, what do you do with the initial samples of the chain?
Back: Discard them because they do not come from the stationary distribution.
Tags: MCMC, Intro
Front: What does the Metropolis Hastings Algorithm allow you to do?
Back: Generate samples from a target distribution using a proposal distribution
Tags: MCMC, MH
Front: What is the key principle of Metropolis Hastings algorithm?
Back: Decide whether to accept a new proposal or reject it based on acceptance probability
Tags: MCMC, MH
Front: If a proposed state is more likely than the current state, will it always be accepted in MH Algorithm?
Back: Yes
Tags: MCMC, MH
Front: What does symmetric proposal in MH mean?
Back: q(x' | x) = q(x | x').
Tags: MCMC, MH
Front: What is acceptance probability in Metropolis Hastings algorithm?
Back: min(1, pi(x')/pi(x)).
Tags: MCMC, MH
Front: What is needed in the MH algorithm if the proposal is asymmetric?
Back: Hastings Correction
Tags: MCMC, MH
Front: What does Hastings correction take into account?
Back: The proposal distribution and target distribution
Tags: MCMC, MH
Front: How does the Gibbs Sampling improve upon MH?
Back: By automatically creating a good proposal distribution, with acceptance probability always 1.
Tags: MCMC, Gibbs Sampling
Front: What does Gibbs sampling exploit?
Back: Conditional independence of the distribution.
Tags: MCMC, Gibbs Sampling
Front: What does the full conditional refer to in Gibbs sampling?
Back: the conditional distribution of a variable given all other variables in the model.
Tags: MCMC, Gibbs Sampling
Front: In Gibbs sampling, what variables are updated at each step?
Back: Only one variable at each time.
Tags: MCMC, Gibbs Sampling
Front: What should we do if we cannot sample from a full conditional distribution when using Gibbs Sampling?
Back: We can use Metropolis Within Gibbs, by using a proposal distribution q.
Tags: MCMC, Metropolis Within Gibbs
Front: What does Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) use?
Back: Gradient information to guide the local moves.
Tags: MCMC, HMC
Front: In MCMC, what does "burn-in phase" refer to?
Back: Initial period where the samples will be ignored.
Tags: MCMC, Convergence
Front: Why do we need to plot trace plots in MCMC?
Back: To check if the method has converged
Tags: MCMC, Convergence
Front: When you plot trace plots, what are you looking for?
Back: That plots converge to the same distribution, i.e., the chains are mixing
Tags: MCMC, Convergence
Front: Is it sufficient for MCMC chain to have reached its stationary distribution?
Back: No, we must also consider the fact that the samples are not independent and hence a lot of samples are needed
Tags: MCMC, Convergence
Front: What is an important term when evaluating results of a MCMC?
Back: Effective sample size
