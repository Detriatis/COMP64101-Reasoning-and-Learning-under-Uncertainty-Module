 What is a key use of MCMC methods?	 Sampling from high-dimensional distributions.	 MCMC, Intro
 What is a key part of the MCMC algorithm construction?	 Construct a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the target density.	 MCMC, Intro
" In MCMC, what is a ""random walk""?"	 We perform a random walk on the state space so that the fraction of time we spend in each state is proportional to the target distribution.	 MCMC, Intro
" What does the ""mixing time"" in MCMC refer to?"	 The time it takes for the Markov chain to reach stationarity.	 MCMC, Intro
 In MCMC, what do you do with the initial samples of the chain?	 Discard them because they do not come from the stationary distribution.	 MCMC, Intro
 What does the Metropolis Hastings Algorithm allow you to do?	 Generate samples from a target distribution using a proposal distribution	 MCMC, MH
 What is the key principle of Metropolis Hastings algorithm?	 Decide whether to accept a new proposal or reject it based on acceptance probability	 MCMC, MH
 If a proposed state is more likely than the current state, will it always be accepted in MH Algorithm?	 Yes	 MCMC, MH
 What does symmetric proposal in MH mean?	 q(x' | x) = q(x | x').	 MCMC, MH
 What is acceptance probability in Metropolis Hastings algorithm?	 min(1, pi(x')/pi(x)).	 MCMC, MH
 What is needed in the MH algorithm if the proposal is asymmetric?	 Hastings Correction	 MCMC, MH
 What does Hastings correction take into account?	 The proposal distribution and target distribution	 MCMC, MH
 How does the Gibbs Sampling improve upon MH?	 By automatically creating a good proposal distribution, with acceptance probability always 1.	 MCMC, Gibbs Sampling
 What does Gibbs sampling exploit?	 Conditional independence of the distribution.	 MCMC, Gibbs Sampling
 What does the full conditional refer to in Gibbs sampling?	 the conditional distribution of a variable given all other variables in the model.	 MCMC, Gibbs Sampling
 In Gibbs sampling, what variables are updated at each step?	 Only one variable at each time.	 MCMC, Gibbs Sampling
 What should we do if we cannot sample from a full conditional distribution when using Gibbs Sampling?	 We can use Metropolis Within Gibbs, by using a proposal distribution q.	 MCMC, Metropolis Within Gibbs
 What does Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) use?	 Gradient information to guide the local moves.	 MCMC, HMC
" In MCMC, what does ""burn-in phase"" refer to?"	 Initial period where the samples will be ignored.	 MCMC, Convergence
 Why do we need to plot trace plots in MCMC?	 To check if the method has converged	 MCMC, Convergence
 When you plot trace plots, what are you looking for?	 That plots converge to the same distribution, i.e., the chains are mixing	 MCMC, Convergence
 Is it sufficient for MCMC chain to have reached its stationary distribution?	 No, we must also consider the fact that the samples are not independent and hence a lot of samples are needed	 MCMC, Convergence
 What is an important term when evaluating results of a MCMC?	 Effective sample size	 MCMC, Convergence
