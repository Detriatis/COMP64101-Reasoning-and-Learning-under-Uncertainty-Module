 What is a good review on priors for BNNs?	" ""Priors in Bayesian Deep Learning  A Review"" by Vincent Fortuin et al"	
 What are the usual choices for priors of weights/biases?	 Gaussian distribution (can be a diagonal matrix to allow independent weights, and the mean usually set at 0)	
 What does nin refer to regarding weight initialization?	 Fan-in, number of nodes in previous layer	
 What does nout refer to regarding weight initialization?	 Fan-out, number of nodes in current layer	
 What does parameter vector ùúÉ represent in BNNs?	 It contains entries of all the matrices and bias vectors (i.e., weights) and variance parameters.	
 What are the Gaussian prior parameters called?	 Hyperparameters.	
 What is an alternative prior in BNNs other than Gaussian?	 Sparsity-promoting prior	
 What is a simplification in defining priors in BNNs?	 Covariance matrix is diagonal or a multiple of the identity	
" What is learned in ""empirical Bayes""?"	 Hyperparameters are optimized by maximizing the marginal likelihood.	
 What is a potential downside of cross-validation?	 It can be computationally expensive since it scales exponentially with the number of hyperparameters.	
 What kind of prior is involved in neural architecture search?	 Architectural priors or structural prior
