    "\n",
    "The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a generalization of the Metropolis algorithm, which was covered in the previous section. These methods are used to generate samples from complex probability distributions, particularly when direct sampling is challenging. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm extends the original Metropolis algorithm by introducing an asymetric approach to the proposal distribution, making it applicable to a broader range of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm Steps:\n",
    "  1. **Initialization:** Start with an initial state $x_0$\n",
    "  2. **Proposal Step:** Generate a proposed state $x^*$ from an arbitrary proposal distribution $q(x^* | x_t)$, which does not need to be symmetric.\n",
    "  3. **Acceptance Step:** Compute the acceptance probability:\n",
    "  $$ \\alpha = \\min \\left( 1, \\frac{\\pi (x^*) \\cdot q(x_t | x^*)}{\\pi(x_t) \\cdot q(x^* | x_t)} \\right)$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Here, the acceptance probability accounts for the asymmetry in the proposal distribution. Accept the proposed state $x^*$ with probability $\\alpha.$ If the proposal is rejected, the chain remains at the current state $x_t$.\n",

    "\n",
    "  1. **Asymetric Proposal Distribution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm allows the use of an asymmetric proposal distirbution. This means that the Metropolis algorithm is still a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, since the asymmetry isn't strict.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. **Acceptance Probability:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  In the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, the acceptance probability $\\alpha$ contains aditional terms $q(x_t | x^*)$ and $q(x^* | x_t)$ to account for the asymmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. **Flexibility:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  The abiliity to use an asymmetric probosal distribution allows for more tailored exploration of the state space. This can potentially lead to faster convergence, particularly in higher-dimensional or complex distributions."

    "### 2.3. Gibbs Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Gibbs Sampling is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method used for generating samples from a joint probability distribution when direct sampling is difficult. It is particularly effective when dealing with high-dimensional distributions. Instead of sampling from the full joint distribution, Gibbs Sampling samples each variable in turn, conditioned on the current values of the other variables. Over many iterations, this process produces samples that approximate the true joint distribution. This decomposition allows for efficient sampling in complex models, especially in Bayesian networks and hierarchical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Gibbs Sampling Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial value for each variable.\n",
    "2. **Sampling**: For each variable, sample from its conditional distribution given the current values of all other variables.\n",
    "3. **Iteration**: Repeat the process for a large number of iterations to approximate the joint distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple Example: Binary Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple model with two binary variables $X_1$ and $X_2$, where each variable can take the value 0 or 1. Suppose we know the following conditional distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ P(X_1 | X_2 = 0) = 0.3$ and $P(X_1 | X_2 = 1) = 0.8$\n",
    "- $P(X_2 | X_1 = 0) = 0.4 $ and $P(X_2 | X_1 = 1) = 0.7$\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to sample from the joint distribution \\( P(X_1, X_2) \\) using Gibbs Sampling.\n",

    "In this example, we used Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to sample from a bivariate Gaussian distribution. The Hamiltonian dynamics allow us to efficiently explore the parameter space, even when the distribution is complex. The Leapfrog method is used to simulate the dynamics, ensuring that the sampler preserves the total energy of the system, which helps in generating accurate samples.\n"
