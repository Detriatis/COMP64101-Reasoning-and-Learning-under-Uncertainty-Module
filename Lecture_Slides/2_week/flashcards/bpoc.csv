 What is the simplest graph for message passing?	 A 1D chain.	 Message Passing, Chains
 What does an HMM model?	 Latent variable sequences	 Message Passing, HMMs
 What are the two main types of variables in an HMM?	 Hidden (latent) and observations.	 Message Passing, HMMs
 What do you compute in the posterior inference of the HMMs?	 The probability distribution of the hidden variables given all of the data.	 Message Passing, HMMs, Inference
 What is an instance of smoothing in terms of HMMs?	 Posterior inference on hidden states.	 Message Passing, HMMs, Smoothing
 What is Forward Filtering Backward Smoothing?	 A method that combines a forward and backward pass in order to obtain smoother results	 Message Passing, HMMs, Smoothing, FFBS
 What needs to be computed to apply the FFBS algorithm?	 The factors of the posterior independently.	 Message Passing, HMMs, Inference
 What are the key steps in the forwards algorithm?	 The factors of the posterior.	 Message Passing, Chains
 What is computed in the backwards pass in forward-backward algorithm?	 The backwards recursions.	 Message Passing, Chains
