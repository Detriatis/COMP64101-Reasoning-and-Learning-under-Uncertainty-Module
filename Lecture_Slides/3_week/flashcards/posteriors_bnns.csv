 Write the formula for the posterior distribution in BNNs.	 p(w|D, θ) = p(D|w, θ)p(w|θ) / p(D|θ)	
 What is the numerator of the posterior formula?	 Likelihood times prior.	
 What is the denominator of the posterior formula?	 Evidence (normalization).	
 Write the formula for 'evidence', or the normalization term.	 p(D|θ) = ∫ p(D|w, θ)p(w|θ) dw	
 In the case of supervised learning, what do we want to compute in BNNs?	 A posterior predictive distribution  p(y|x, D, θ).	
 Name five methods for approximating posteriors in BNNs.	 Monte Carlo dropout, Laplace approximation, variational inference, expectation propagation, last layer methods.	
 Name five more methods for approximating posteriors in BNNs.	 SNGP, MCMC methods, SGD trajectory based methods, Deep ensembles, Approximating the posterior predictive distribution, Tempered and cold posteriors
